Murgers is a mod for the game, [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).

### The Game

Minecraft is the best selling game ever. It is a survival sandbox where you can do whatever you choose to.

### The Mod

I have added a new set a food items that the player can craft. There is also a naturally generating structure and advancements based around the food set I have added. You can see all of the source code on the [github](https://github.com/JJplayz565/Murgers). This was fun to make as I was learning how Minecraft worked.

## What I Used

To create this mod, I used the IDE Visual Studio Code. The languages used are Java, JSON, NBT and minecraft's own language, mcfunction.
