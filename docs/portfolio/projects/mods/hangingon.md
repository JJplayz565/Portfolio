HangingOn is a mod for the game, [PEAK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/).

### The Game

PEAK is a co-op game in which the players must reach the top of a mountain without dying to falls, flora and fauna, and hunger. PEAK was made in Unity.

### The Mod

If a player falls unconscious, a timer counts down and when it reaches 0, that player dies. In the base game, the timer would last about a minute but my mod allows the user to customise the length of the timer, or disable it entirely. After creating this mod I felt as though I had accomplished something as it was my first time deep diving into other people's code and understanding what it all did.

## What I Used

To create this mod I used the IDE Visual Studio Code. The language used is C# as PEAK is a Unity game.
