# Snake Game

### My First Game

Snake Game is the first game I made excluding ones from tutorials. Because of this, it is very simple and not astoundingly well-made. This was very fun to make as I was learning it all while making it.

### Incompletion

Unfortunately, I lost the project files when upgrading my computer so it never got finished. I hadn't even come up with a name yet!

## What I Used

To create this game, I used Unity. The language used is C# and I edited this in Visual Studio 2022.
