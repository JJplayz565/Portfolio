# Glitchbound

![Glitchbound Gameplay](/Portfolio/assets/images/glitchbound-gameplay.gif)

I made Glitchbound for an assignment at Loughborough College so it is only a small demo for what the full game could be.

### Character Selection

I made it possible for the player to choose a character at the start of the game. All the assets are from an [asset pack on Fab](https://fab.com/s/9e449a0dce55). I did this by creating a dropdown and, when updated, it changed the mesh and texture of the character shown on screen. When the player clicks "Confirm", the chosen character is saved and used in the next part. I enjoyed learning how to do this from scratch.

### Options

I added some options for player's to change. I did this by creating a check box that, when updated, would save the chosen option state.

### Checkpoints

I made it so that if the player died, they would respawn at a set point they had already reached. I did this by setting triggers at certain points in the world so that when the player fell, they would be teleported to a point.

## What I Used

To create this game, I used Unreal Engine 5. I used UE's language, Blueprints.
